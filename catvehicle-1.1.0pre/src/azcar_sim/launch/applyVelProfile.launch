Summary:
========

This launch file applies a velocity profile to the leader car already loaded into the simulator.

Prerequisite:
=============

1. Load the world
roslaunch azcar_sim azcar_empty.launch

2. Load the leader
roslaunch azcar_sim humancar_spwan_nocmd.launch robot1:=azcar_sim X:=0 Y:=0 Z:=0 roll:=0 pitch:=0 yaw:=0

3. Load the follower
roslaunch azcar_sim humancar_spwan_nocmd.launch robot1:=follower_sim X:=10 Y:=0 Z:=0 roll:=0 pitch:=0 yaw:=0

How to execute this file?
roslaunch azcar_sim applyVelProfile.launch leader_robot:=car1
