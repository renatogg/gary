Summary: 
=========
This launch file loads the worlds and models for the azcar and follow the velocity profile specified in the latter part of this code.

Prerequisite:
=============

1. Load the empty world with skidpan

roslaunch azcar_sim azcar_empty.launch

How to excute this file:
=======================

roslaunch azcar_sim humancar_newspawn.launch

-->

<launch>
