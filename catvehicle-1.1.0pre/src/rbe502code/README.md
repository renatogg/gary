README

Need to create a .launch file for this!
Commands To run (each in a tab):

* roslaunch rbe502code pathPlanner.launch

* rosrun rbe502code carPathPlanner.py

Currently, you can use the "2D Pose Estimate" and the "2D Nav Goal" buttons in rviz to send commands to the pathPlanner.py
When A* completes, the path is printed onto the map.
